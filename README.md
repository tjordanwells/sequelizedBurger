# Eat Ze Burger

## A Full Stack MySQL application

### Summary

This application allows the user to add a burger that they would like to eat using the input field. When the submission goes through the application adds the burger to the MySQL database and adds it to the list of burgers that are available to eat.

Each burger is placed in a row with a corresponding "Devour It!" button. When clicked, this updates the table's "devoured" column to true and pushes the burger to the other table of burgers that have been eaten.

### Install

```
git clone git@github.com:tjordanwells/burger.git
cd burger
npm i
```

This will clone the repository, take you into the directory and install all of the npm dependencies required to run the application.

Then enter:

```
node server.js
```

and go to ```localhost:8080``` in your browser
